Network Interface?
a network interface is the point of connection between a computer and a network

A network interface is just a connection point between your computer (or server) and a network (like the internet or a local network).

Interface	What it means        	 	Example name in Linux
🧵 Ethernet	Wired connection		    eth0, enp0s3
📶 Wi-Fi	        Wireless connection	             		   wlan0
🔁 Loopback	Internal (connects to itself)		lo
🌐 Virtual	Used by virtual machines or Docker	docker0, veth1234



 1. Old Style (Classic names)

Old Linux systems (before 2015) used short, easy names:

Type	              Example name			Meaning
Ethernet (wired)	eth0, eth1, eth2	First, second, third Ethernet port
Wi-Fi (wireless)	wlan0, wlan1		First, second wireless card
Loopback	 	lo		Always the internal “self” connection

Example:
If you plugged in two Ethernet cables, Linux would name them eth0 and eth1.

✅ Simple, but...
❌ Sometimes names changed randomly after reboot or hardware change — which caused server problems.



2. New Style (Predictable names)

To fix that, Linux introduced Predictable Network Interface Names around 2015.

These names describe where the hardware is physically connected on the motherboard.

Examples:

New Name	Type			Meaning
enp3s0	 	Ethernet	en = Ethernet, p3 = PCI bus 3, s0 = slot 0
ens33		Ethernet	Ethernet, slot 33
wlp2s0		Wi-Fi		wl = Wireless LAN, p2 = PCI bus 2, s0 = slot 0

🧠 These names come from hardware location, not boot order —
so they never change when you restart or plug new devices.

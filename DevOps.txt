Network Interface?
a network interface is the point of connection between a computer and a network

A network interface is just a connection point between your computer (or server) and a network (like the internet or a local network).

Interface	What it means        	 	Example name in Linux
🧵 Ethernet	Wired connection		       eth0, enp0s3
📶 Wi-Fi	Wireless connection	           wlan0
🔁 Loopback	Internal(connects to itself)		lo
🌐 Virtual	Used by virtual machines or Docker	docker0, veth1234

enp0s3==en(Ethernet (wired connection))--p0==(PCI bus number → 0)--s3==Slot number → 3
pci==Peripheral Component Interconnect.
It’s a hardware bus (a kind of connection system) inside your computer that lets the CPU talk to devices like:
Network cards (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
Sound cards
Graphics cards (GPUs)
USB controllers
Storage controllers

To See All Network Interfaces
ip link show

Bring the Interface Up or Down
sudo ip link set enp0s3 down
sudo ip link set enp0s3 up


 1. Old Style (Classic names)

Old Linux systems (before 2015) used short, easy names:

Type	              Example name			Meaning
Ethernet (wired)	eth0, eth1, eth2	First, second, third Ethernet port
Wi-Fi (wireless)	wlan0, wlan1		First, second wireless card
Loopback	 	lo		Always the internal “self” connection

Example:
If you plugged in two Ethernet cables, Linux would name them eth0 and eth1.

✅ Simple, but...
❌ Sometimes names changed randomly after reboot or hardware change — which caused server problems.



2. New Style (Predictable names)

To fix that, Linux introduced Predictable Network Interface Names around 2015.

These names describe where the hardware is physically connected on the motherboard.

Examples:

New Name	Type			Meaning
enp3s0	 	Ethernet	en = Ethernet, p3 = PCI bus 3, s0 = slot 0
ens33		Ethernet	Ethernet, slot 33
wlp2s0		Wi-Fi		wl = Wireless LAN, p2 = PCI bus 2, s0 = slot 0

🧠 These names come from hardware location, not boot order —
so they never change when you restart or plug new devices.

NETWORK INTERFACE CARD

 ls command and the sys file system to quickly list the available network
 interfaces. Each entry in the /sys/class/net directory represents a physical or virtual network interface:

 ls /sys/class/net

To get more details about the network interfaces. we can use the
 ip link command:
Here, we can see three network interfaces, their type, and their state.
 Alternatively, we can also use the ifconfig command.

In addition, to get the IP address and other related information, we use  the ip addr command:

You can open it with:

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

man ip link
man ip
man ip address
ifquery


-----

What Is /etc/network/interfaces?

It’s the file in Linux (especially Debian or older Ubuntu) that tells the system how to connect to the internet — which network card to use, what IP to give, and whether it’s static or dynamic.

Think of it like a Wi-Fi settings file that loads automatically when your system starts.

⚙️ Basic Syntax
1. Start network interface automatically at boot:
auto eth0


💬 Means: "Start the Ethernet (eth0) connection automatically when the system boots."

2. Define how a network interface behaves:
iface <interface> <address_family> <method>


Example:

iface eth0 inet dhcp


Meaning:

iface → defines a network interface

eth0 → the interface name (like your LAN cable)

inet → IPv4 protocol

dhcp → get IP automatically from the router

🌐 Two Ways to Get IP
🟢 1. Dynamic (Automatic) — DHCP

Let the router assign IP automatically:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

🔵 2. Static (Manual)

You assign IP yourself:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.100
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4


💬 This means:

Always use IP → 192.168.1.100

Router (gateway) → 192.168.1.1

Google DNS → 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4

⚡ Special Options
Option	Meaning
pre-up <command>	Run this command before interface starts
post-up <command>	Run this command after interface starts
pre-down <command>	Run this command before interface stops
post-down <command>	Run this command after interface stops

Example:

pre-up /usr/local/sbin/start-iptables.sh
post-down /usr/local/sbin/backup-log.sh


💬 Means run the firewall before connecting, and backup logs after disconnecting.

🔁 Enable or Disable Interfaces Manually

You can manually start or stop a network interface:

sudo ifup eth0     # Turn ON the network
sudo ifdown eth0   # Turn OFF the network


After editing the file, apply changes by:

sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0

🧩 Full Example

Here’s how a full static configuration looks:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.100
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
pre-up /usr/local/sbin/start-iptables.sh
post-down /usr/local/sbin/backup-log.sh

🚫 Why Your /etc/network/interfaces File Might Be Empty

If the file is empty — don’t panic 😄
It usually means another tool is managing your network, like:

NetworkManager (used on desktop Ubuntu)

Netplan (used on newer Ubuntu versions)

To use /etc/network/interfaces, you need to disable NetworkManager:

sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager.service


----------

sudo nana /etc/network/interface

Step 2: Paste this content

Paste your configuration (replace eth0 with your interface name — e.g. ens33 if that’s what your system uses):

auto ens33
iface ens33 inet static
    address 192.168.1.100
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
pre-up /usr/local/sbin/start-iptables.sh
post-down /usr/local/sbin/backup-log.sh

🔹 Step 3: Save & Exit

Press:

CTRL + O → Enter → CTRL + X

🔹 Step 4: Restart Networking

To apply your new configuration, run:

sudo ifdown ens33 && sudo ifup ens33


or restart your network service:

sudo systemctl restart networking

3.	GREP:
a.	grep one number, multiple numbers, everything except one number
b.	grep case sensitive/insensitive character 
c.	grep specific files with patterns
d.	use grep to look for files which contains the word for instance 'HTTP'
e.	use grep to count numbers having prefix 0301,0302                                         
f.	grep two lines of trailing context after each match                                            
g.	grep two lines of leading context before each match                                        
h.	grep two lines of leading and trailing context surrounding each match   
i.	grep regex matching (just study it to how know)


What is grep?

grep is used to search for text patterns inside files or output.
It shows lines that match what you’re looking for.

Example:

grep "error" /var/log/syslog


👉 Finds all lines containing the word “error” in the syslog file.

🔹 a. grep one number, multiple numbers, everything except one number

Let’s say we have a file called numbers.txt like:

0301
0302
0303
0401
0502

👉 Find one number (e.g., 0301):
grep "0301" numbers.txt

👉 Find multiple numbers (e.g., 0301 or 0302):
grep -E "0301|0302" numbers.txt


(-E enables extended regex for “OR” patterns.)

👉 Find everything except one number (e.g., not 0301):
grep -v "0301" numbers.txt


(-v = inverse match → exclude pattern)

🔹 b. grep case sensitive / insensitive

Suppose you have:

HTTP
http
Https

Case sensitive (default)
grep "HTTP" file.txt


→ Only matches HTTP (uppercase).

Case insensitive
grep -i "http" file.txt


→ Matches HTTP, http, and Https.

🔹 c. grep specific files with patterns

Search for a pattern in specific files:

grep "root" /etc/passwd


Search inside multiple files:

grep "error" *.log


Search recursively in a directory:

grep -r "error" /var/log

🔹 d. use grep to look for files containing a word (e.g. “HTTP”)

You can search inside all files:

grep -rl "HTTP" /etc


-r → recursive

-l → list only filenames that contain the word

🔹 e. use grep to count numbers having prefix 0301, 0302
grep -E "0301|0302" numbers.txt | wc -l


-E → extended regex for OR patterns

wc -l → counts number of matching lines

🔹 f. grep two lines of trailing context after each match

If your file has:

Line1
Error
Line2
Line3


and you run:

grep -A 2 "Error" logfile.txt


-A (After) shows 2 lines after the match:

Error
Line2
Line3

🔹 g. grep two lines of leading context before each match
grep -B 2 "Error" logfile.txt


-B (Before) shows 2 lines before the match:

Line1
Error

🔹 h. grep two lines of leading and trailing context
grep -C 2 "Error" logfile.txt


-C (Context) = 2 lines before and after each match.

🔹 i. grep regex matching (just study it)

Regular expressions (regex) allow advanced searching — patterns instead of plain text.

Examples:

grep -E "^[0-9]{4}$" numbers.txt


→ matches exactly 4 digits

grep -E "^[A-Z]+" file.txt


→ matches lines starting with uppercase letters

✅ Summary Table
Option	Meaning	Example
-i	Ignore case	grep -i "http" file
-v	Invert match	grep -v "0301" file
-r	Recursive search	grep -r "error" /etc
-l	Show only filenames	grep -l "HTTP" /etc
-A N	Show N lines after	grep -A 2 "error" log
-B N	Show N lines before	grep -B 2 "error" log
-C N	Show N lines around	grep -C 2 "error" log

Mode	What it does	How to enter
Normal Mode	Move, copy, delete, search	Press Esc
Insert Mode	Type or edit text	Press i
Command Mode	Run commands like save, replace, quit	Press :
⚙️ a. Copy, Paste, Search, Replace, etc.
Copy (Yank)

yy → copy (yank) one line

2yy → copy two lines

yG → copy from current line to end of file

Paste

p → paste below

P → paste above

Cut (Delete)

dd → delete (cut) one line

2dd → delete two lines

Undo / Redo

u → undo

Ctrl + r → redo

Search for Text

/word → search forward for “word”

n → next match

N → previous match

Replace Text

:%s/old/new/g → replace all “old” with “new”

:%s/old/new/gc → same but asks for confirmation each time

🔢 b. Search a Number in File

In Vim (Normal mode), type:

/[0-9]


→ searches for any number.
You can press n to jump to the next one.

If you want to find specific numbers (like 0301):

/0301

🔁 c. Replace 92 from Start of Every Number

Let’s say you have:

9234567
9201111
9233333
0301333


Command:

:%s/^92//


Explanation:

% → entire file

s → substitute

^92 → means “92 at the start of a line”

// → replace with nothing (remove it)

Result:

34567
01111
33333
0301333

🔁 d. Replace 0 from Start of Every Number with 921

If you have:

0301
0302
0303


Command:

:%s/^0/921/


Explanation:

^0 → means “0 at start of line”

921 → the replacement text

Result:

921301
921302
921303

🏷️ e. Add “Ufone” at the End of Every Number

Command:

:%s/$/ Ufone/


Explanation:

$ → end of line

Adds " Ufone" at the end of each line

Result:

921301 Ufone
921302 Ufone
921303 Ufone

🏷️ f. Add “Ufone” at the Start of Every Number

Command:

:%s/^/Ufone /


Explanation:

^ → start of line

Adds "Ufone " before each line

Result:

Ufone 921301
Ufone 921302
Ufone 921303

	GREP: VIM: AWK: SED
a.	delete all numbers starting from 92, replace end line character with anything else etc etc.
b.	Count of lines this file contains
c.	Each line starts with datetime then log type, count 'Sent SMS' logs.
d.	Get output which contains the first 10 'Sent SMS' logs on terminal.  
e.	Get output which contains the first 25 'Sent SMS' logs on terminal.  
f.	Get output which contains the last 15 'Sent SMS' logs on terminal.  
g.	Sort out the details on terminal from 'Sent SMS' logs in such format:"date time, Source_Mask, Destination, Message Length"


et’s assume you have a log file named logs.txt containing lines like 👇

2025-10-22 10:15:32 INFO Sent SMS Source_Mask=92300 Destination=923111111111 Length=150
2025-10-22 10:15:33 INFO Sent SMS Source_Mask=92301 Destination=923222222222 Length=140
2025-10-22 10:15:34 WARN Failed to send SMS Source_Mask=92302 Destination=923333333333
2025-10-22 10:15:35 INFO Sent SMS Source_Mask=92303 Destination=923444444444 Length=130


We’ll use this file to practice each command.

🧹 a. Delete all numbers starting from 92, replace end line character with anything else, etc.
Using sed:
Delete numbers starting with 92:
sed 's/92[0-9]*//g' logs.txt


Explanation:

s/old/new/g → substitute globally

92[0-9]* → match 92 followed by any digits

// → replace with nothing (delete)

Result example:

2025-10-22 10:15:32 INFO Sent SMS Source_Mask= Destination= Length=150

Replace end-of-line character $ with something (like “#”):
sed 's/$/#/' logs.txt


→ adds a # at the end of each line.

🔢 b. Count of lines this file contains
Using wc:
wc -l logs.txt


→ shows total number of lines in file.

OR using grep:
grep -c "" logs.txt


→ counts all lines (since every line matches the empty string).

📨 c. Each line starts with datetime then log type — count ‘Sent SMS’ logs
Using grep:
grep -c "Sent SMS" logs.txt


→ shows how many lines contain the words “Sent SMS”.

Using awk:
awk '/Sent SMS/ {count++} END {print count}' logs.txt


→ counts using AWK script.

🔟 d. Show first 10 “Sent SMS” logs on terminal
grep "Sent SMS" logs.txt | head -n 10


Explanation:

grep filters the lines containing “Sent SMS”

head -n 10 shows only the first 10

2️⃣5️⃣ e. Show first 25 “Sent SMS” logs
grep "Sent SMS" logs.txt | head -n 25

🔚 f. Show last 15 “Sent SMS” logs
grep "Sent SMS" logs.txt | tail -n 15

📊 g. Sort and extract formatted data:

“date time, Source_Mask, Destination, Message Length”

Use awk (powerful log parser):

grep "Sent SMS" logs.txt | awk '{ 
    date=$1; 
    time=$2; 
    split($0,a," "); 
    for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){
        if($i ~ /Source_Mask=/) sm=substr($i,13);
        if($i ~ /Destination=/) dst=substr($i,13);
        if($i ~ /Length=/) len=substr($i,8);
    } 
    print date, time ",", sm ",", dst ",", len 
}'


Output:

2025-10-22 10:15:32 , 92300 , 923111111111 , 150
2025-10-22 10:15:33 , 92301 , 923222222222 , 140
